Sharing information in this issue since the TCK work is being tracked in temurin-compliance private repo not visible to the community (as per the OCTLA).  Risks and expectations for timing on the release are listed in this [issue comment](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium/issues/3#issuecomment-866903922).  Primary platforms (x64 Linux/Windows/OSX and aarch64 Linux/OSX) in **bold** are prioritized, secondary platforms not in bold follow in no particular order (as machine resources are available).  We retrospectively measure and track how well we do against these targets in these [Adoptium Release Scorecards](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium/wiki/Adoptium-Release-Scorecards) in order to continuously assess and improve.

✔️ results in these Tables means the activity has successfully completed.

⏳ results means that we are actively working on closing off the runs needed for this version, platform, binaryType.

⛔ means there is no build planned for that version/platform combination.

⏸️ means activity not yet started.
